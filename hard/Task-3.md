#### Task-3: Propose a plan (no need to provide code but it is welcomed as example, no need to run it) to analyze issues to learn how to make high quality issues: What questions would be interesting? How would you answer them? (Critical thinking and independence)

> After perusing the documentation of bugRzilla, I might want to propose a few upgrades in the undertaking which are as per the following:

1. In, **Bugzilla â€“ Reporting and Charting Kitchen** the segment of:
    1. **Current State** in the **duplicates** the button "Bug list" doesn't seems to be working. The main is to give the list of all issues. As well as there is mention "Please press Back and try again" the addition of back button is required.
    2. **Current State** in the **Tabular reports** visualization option are given to extract the plots but they are not in development phase. So visualizations like bar graph, line graph should be developed.
    3. **Change Over Time** the old charts just give a static view, as on various datasets for example new, assigned, reopened, and so on taking all things together of these the X-hub is marked distinctly with a date. To make it dynamic the zoom(in/out), time-series plots like at what time, the day the issues are raised, shut, etc, and so forth can from the chart one be redirected to the issue in an alternate tab.

2. **Addition of visualizations**: For the section, **Common Queries**:
    1. Time-series, bar graphs which would be visualized which will make it more handy to keep a track on the **Bugs reported in the last 24 hours | last 7 days** and **Bugs changed in the last 24 hours | last 7 days**

3. Section **2.4.4. Life Cycle of a Bug** the link for diagram file does not redirect to image file.
