# Task-2
### Create a function that opens on the browser a desired bug report on Bugzilla. Create some tests for the function. (Level of technical skills)
> In this, I've imported bugRzilla library. Created a function desired_bug() in which I've defined the base_url and passed a formal argument i.e. "id". which is further passed in the browseURL() function in which base_url and id are concatenated and will be redirected to the browser. And created a test to check whether the function is working properly or not. In test, I've used the for loop to get issue_id and stored in the list, used a sample() function to take any random value which is the formal argument for the function desired_bug().
