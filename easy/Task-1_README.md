# Task-1
### Find the first 5 issues posted on Bugzilla. This can be done with the package or through Bugzilla (Check familiarity with bugRzilla code and Bugzilla)
> I've used bugRzilla library and bugtractr library. Used a list_bug() function to get the list of issues and used head() function to first part of the issues posted on Bugzilla.
