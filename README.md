# bugRzilla_GSoC'21_Task
> Task-1 : Easy: Find the first 5 issues posted on Bugzilla. This can be done with the package or through Bugzilla (Check familiarity with bugRzilla code and Bugzilla).

> Task-2 : Medium: Create a function that opens on the browser a desired bug report on Bugzilla. Create some tests for the function. (Level of technical skills)

> Task-3 : Hard: Propose a plan (no need to provide code but it is welcomed as example, no need to run it) to analyze issues to learn how to make high quality issues: What questions would be interesting? How would you answer them? (Critical thinking and independence)
